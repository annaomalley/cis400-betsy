HOW TO USE THE DATABASE WITH THE WEBSITE

*****************
***PLEASE READ***
*****************

We are setting up a local instance of a database. This local instance 
is a real database that will  run on your computer.  The server.js file
(which is the  SERVER side of the website; the client HTML files can't 
access it) will make the call based on a query in the URL when navigating 
around the website,  then send the data and the HTML file to the client 
(ie. your web browser). 

When you make an SQL instance, it is different and distinct from the 
instances on everyone else's computer. We are going to use the same 
access methods, upload  the same data, etc. to our instances so they're  
virtually identical. These instructions will tell you how to do that.

***INSTRUCTIONS**
*****************

FOLLOW THESE CAREFULLY AND EXACTLY

1. Install MySQL Workbench. 
	- https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

2. Install MySQL Community Server
	- https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

3. Run MySQL Community Server It will begin to run immediately, but 
will first prompt you to insert a password. Make your password "abc123".

4. Run MySQL Workbench. There will be a (+) button. Click it to start 
to connect to your database  server. There will be some default  options;
the only thing you need to do is name it something like "localdb".

5. In the folder where you found this file, there  are two SQL files. 
Copy the contents of initscripts.sql and run it on Workbench. Then run 
the testscripts.tql on the Workbench. You should see results of your 
query displayed.  If it does, your database is working.

6. Run "npm build; npm start" in the website folder of the project to 
start the website. In your console, you should see some example output 
of the database right away.

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS, REACH OUT RIGHT AWAY. We don't have time to waste;
lets all get on the same page.
